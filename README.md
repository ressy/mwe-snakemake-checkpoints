# Minimal Working Example - Snakemake Checkpoints

I had a much harder time than I expected wrapping my head around how
[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/) implements its checkpoint
system, so I added notes to make it clearer to me.  The [Snakefile](Snakefile)
here is derived from 
[the clustering example in the documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html#data-dependent-conditional-execution).
See the docstrings in the Snakefile for notes.
